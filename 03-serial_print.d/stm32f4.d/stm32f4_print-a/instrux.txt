Instructions - STM32F407VGT6

 $ cat /some/path/to/.arduino15/preferences.txt | sed 1q
board=GenF4

 $ st-flash reset # optional

 $ st-flash write  this_program.ino.bin 0x08000000

Press black RESET button between any two commands, if board is
unresponsive.

No new jumper settings - keep as shipped from factory.

If you want to run the board stand-alone, powered by the
microUSB-b port, CN5 (smaller of the two; the other is a
mini designated CN1) you can jumper PA9 to 5V (read schematic
as to why) (CAUTION! NEEDS REVIEW - unsure this is correct).

The other USB port (on CN1) already powers the board, as-shipped.

Interference from the two USB ports (both plugged into the
host PC) is the basis to want a stand-alone USB on the
USB micro-B port (CN5).

CN1 connects to STM32F103 (U2) ST-LINK programmed MCU.

CN5 connects to STM32F407 (Ux) target (appliction) MCU
at PA11 and PA12.

PA9 is a convenient header pin to source VBUS from CN5
(and pass it along to the 5V pin, to distribute power).

END.
