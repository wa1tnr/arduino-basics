 Simple upload to the target succeeded 32u4 5V 16 MHz ItsyBitsy

 The test program already resident was reminiscent of
 the current program, so difficult to differentiate.

 Will modify accordingly.

 Note: new target from factory; new USB cable from them.

 Packaged the target inside a plastic housing, so there
 was no access (at all) to the reset button.

 The upload succeeded anyway. ;)
