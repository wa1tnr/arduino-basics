millis();
interrupts
Debounce.ino (Arduino IDE example program)
storing values into an array as they arrive
Shattuck's Forth-Like Interpreter mentioned

[3:42 PM] tnr: use millis()
[3:42 PM] tnr: Play with it. Get it, print it, see what it does.

[3:43 PM] tnr: arduino.cc has help pages for all inbuilt functions such as millis();

[3:44 PM] tnr: Basically, millis(); is like when you look at the kitchen clock, remember what time it said it was, then go off and do something.  Come back to the kitchen, look at the clock a second time, and say to yourself 'wow, ten minutes have passed - I must have been daydreaming.'

[3:44 PM] tnr: millis() is the time it said it was, both times.

[4:26 PM] tnr: https://www.gammon.com.au/interrupts

For interrupts.

Otherwise, look at the example sketches in the Arduino IDE for pushbutton foo.

[4:34 PM] tnr: debounce:

[4:37 PM] tnr: Interrupts Tutorial:

https://thekurks.net/blog/2016/4/25/using-interrupts

[4:38 PM] tnr: All of the packaged Arduino examples, in one place:

https://github.com/arduino/arduino-examples

[4:39 PM] tnr: This is the Debounce.ino example from the Arduino IDE:

https://github.com/arduino/arduino-examples/tree/main/examples/02.Digital/Debounce

[4:41 PM] tnr: That one is a millis(); based solution:

https://github.com/arduino/arduino-examples/blob/main/examples/02.Digital/Debounce/Debounce.ino#L63

[5:06 PM] tnr: In Shattuck's Forth-Like Interpreter,

push(); increments automatically.

https://github.com/CharleyShattuck/Feather-M0-interpreter/blob/master/Interpreter.ino#L34

[5:07 PM] tnr: He basically declares an array of ints, with the current array element as TOS (top of stack).

[5:07 PM] tnr: Then just maintains the index into that array of ints, to form an ersatz Forth 'stack'.
[5:08 PM] tnr: It's also the basics of a ring buffer.

[5:12 PM] tnr: That stack structure is FIFO with wrap-around.
[5:13 PM] tnr: aka ring buffer ;)

[5:13 PM] tnr: it is not a push-down stack at all.
[5:13 PM] tnr: (and it's not a stack; it's a global array of ints used like a stack, but it isn't a stack, per se)



[5:16 PM] tnr: I have a thermometer program that records the temperature as HOT COLD or MIXED/TRANSITIONING.

[5:16 PM] tnr: Every 3 minutes or so.
[5:16 PM] tnr: Blue RGB is cold; red is hot and green means it's transitioning.
[5:17 PM] tnr: So I just walk into the room - if I see all BLUE RGB's (array of 8 of them) I know it hasn't cycled since 3 * 8 = 24 minutes.
[5:17 PM] tnr: it == air conditioner ;)


[5:18 PM] tnr: It uses Charley Shattuck's circular stack (FIFO) and the oldest temperature drops off the end and is lost to history.


[5:20 PM] tnr: This looks like an abstraction to demo some of that:

https://github.com/wa1tnr/ring-led-a/blob/master/ring-led-aa/sketch_ring-led-aa.cpp
[5:21 PM] tnr: It basically simulates the LED's with Serial.print("foo"); statements at the terminal.
[5:21 PM] tnr: As usual, I didn't remove unused code. ;)


[5:23 PM] tnr: Bear in mind the stack size must be an exact multiple of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ..) or it breaks the program.
[5:23 PM] tnr: Just put in placeholders to 'absorb' the unused slots, if, say, you need 12 slots.
[5:23 PM] tnr: (called a nop for no operation ;)


[5:24 PM] tnr: The wrap-around feature basically uses a logical AND to strip off the most significant bit, during overflow.
[5:24 PM] tnr: (of the stack 'index')


[5:25 PM] tnr: 8-element stack: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ..

[5:25 PM] tnr: When it gets to 7, it increments by one (as always) which gets stripped off to become a zero again.


0 0 0 0  zero
0 0 0 1 one
0 0 1 0 two
.
.
0 1 1 0 six
0 1 1 1 seven
1 0 0 0 eight - illegal (overflow)
0 0 0 0 zero (again - high bit stripped off of eight)


[5:28 PM] tnr: You can do all that with straight math on any base at all (base 11, base 121 .. anything).


[5:29 PM] tnr: But the use of a logical AND operates on a single bit (usually) so that restricts simpler use to powers of two.



[5:30 PM] tnr: This guy here does all that work:

https://github.com/wa1tnr/ring-led-a/blob/master/ring-led-aa/sketch_ring-led-aa.cpp#L34

[5:31 PM] tnr: (also on line 41 for the inverse case, where you are 'pop'-ing off the stack, to decrement that index.)

[5:32 PM] tnr: TOS stack[p] is a cpp macro btw.

[5:33 PM] tnr: p is a global integer and is the stack index (or 'pointer').

END.
